**What is self-reflection?**

Self-reflection refers to the ability to
 observe and analyze one's own thoughts, feelings, and actions. This 
includes recognizing one's own weaknesses and strengths, reflecting on 
one's own goals and values, and questioning one's own convictions and 
assumptions. Self-reflection is an important aspect of human learning 
and personality development.
