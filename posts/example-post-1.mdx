Self-reflection refers to the ability to
observe and analyze one's own thoughts, feelings, and actions. This
includes recognizing one's own weaknesses and strengths, reflecting on
one's own goals and values, and questioning one's own convictions and
assumptions. Self-reflection is an important aspect of human learning
and personality development.
